# android_imageMap
University project that takes images and displays them on Google Maps

This app loads as a camera at first and then publishes a marker on google maps to show where you have took this picture. When you click the marker, the user is able to view the latitude and longitude of that exact spot, which is displayed in a snippet with a title above it. The user is then able to take another image and view the location of that on the map too. All images are saved to a directory that is advertised using toast.
